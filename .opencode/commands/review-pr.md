# Review Pull Request

You are a token-efficient code reviewer. The user will provide a PR number or you will auto-detect it from the current branch. Delegate deterministic checks to local tools and CI results first, then apply AI judgment only where tools cannot reach: intent alignment, security patterns, and architectural concerns.

## Arguments

- **PR number** (optional): The pull request number to review (e.g., `42`). If omitted, the command auto-detects the open PR for the current branch.

**Argument parsing** (before any tool calls): Check the
user's message for a PR number argument. If present, set
`PR_NUMBER` to that value immediately. All subsequent steps
use `<PR_NUMBER>` — no auto-detection commands are needed
or permitted.

## Execution Steps

### 0. Prerequisites

Verify the `gh` CLI is available and authenticated before proceeding:

```bash
which gh
```

If `gh` is not found: **STOP** with error:
> "`gh` CLI is not installed. Install it from https://cli.github.com/ or via your package manager."

If `gh` is found, verify authentication:

```bash
gh auth status
```

If not authenticated: **STOP** with error:
> "`gh` is installed but not authenticated. Run `gh auth login` to authenticate."

#### Execution Mode Check

This command requires running local tools (build, test,
lint) as part of the review. Verify you can execute
commands by running a harmless probe:

```bash
echo "mode-check-ok"
```

If the probe cannot be executed (the agent runtime
returns a tool-access-denied error, or you are in plan
mode, read-only mode, or otherwise restricted from
running commands): **STOP** with message:

> "This review requires running local tools (build,
> test, lint) to verify the PR. I am currently in
> plan/read-only mode which prevents executing these
> checks. Switch to a mode that allows command
> execution (e.g., full mode / auto mode) and
> re-invoke `/review-pr <N>`."

Do NOT proceed with a partial review that skips local
tool execution. The local tool results are the
foundation of the review — without them, AI-only
findings lack verification and the review does not
meet the command's quality standard.

### 1. Resolve PR Number

**If `PR_NUMBER` was already set from the argument**: skip
this step entirely. Do NOT run `gh pr view`,
`git branch --show-current`, or any branch/PR detection
commands.

**Only if no PR number was provided**: auto-detect from
the current branch:

```bash
gh pr view --json number --jq '.number'
```

If no open PR exists for the current branch: **STOP** with error:
> "No open PR found for branch '`<branch>`'. Provide a PR number: `/review-pr 42`"

### 2. Fetch PR Metadata (Minimal)

Retrieve PR metadata first — avoid loading the full diff until needed:

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json title,body,files,additions,deletions,baseRefName,headRefName,labels,milestone,commits,reviewDecision,reviewRequests
```

Record the PR title, description, branch name, base branch, changed file list, current review decision (`REVIEW_REQUIRED`, `APPROVED`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`), and pending review requests. **Do NOT fetch the full diff yet** — later steps determine which files need AI analysis.

### 3. Fetch CI Check Results

Retrieve the CI/CD check suite status for the PR:

```bash
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --json name,state,description,link
```

Categorize each check as:
- **PASS**: Check succeeded
- **FAIL**: Check failed
- **PENDING**: Check still running
- **SKIPPED**: Check was skipped

If checks are still PENDING, inform the user and ask whether to wait or proceed with the available results.

**If all checks pass**: Record this and move to Step 4. No CI triage needed.

**If any checks fail**: Proceed to Step 3a for causality determination.

#### 3a. CI Failure Causality Determination

For each failing check, determine whether the failure is caused by the PR's changes or is a pre-existing issue on the base branch.

**Method**: Check if the same test/check also fails on the base branch:

```bash
# Get the base branch name (from Step 2 metadata, e.g., "main")
BASE_BRANCH="<baseRefName from Step 2>"

# Check the latest CI status on the base branch
# Use --jq with $ENVIRON or --arg to avoid injection from check names containing quotes
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/${BASE_BRANCH}/check-runs \
  --jq --arg name "<FAILING_CHECK_NAME>" '.check_runs[] | select(.name == $name) | {name, conclusion}'
```

**Classification**:

| Base branch status | PR check status | Classification |
|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Pass | Fail | **PR-caused** — the PR introduced the failure |
| Fail | Fail | **Pre-existing** — failure exists independently of the PR |
| No data | Fail | **Unknown** — treat as PR-caused (conservative) |

Record the classification for each failing check. This feeds into Step 8 (AI review) and Step 10 (fix-branch).

### 4. Run Local Deterministic Tools (Pre-flight)

Run the project's own tools as a rapid pre-flight check.

**Detection**: Check which tools are available by looking
for their configuration files:

```bash
test -f Makefile && echo "MAKEFILE=yes"
test -f .golangci.yml && echo "GO_LINT=yes"
test -f ruff.toml -o -f pyproject.toml && echo "PYTHON_LINT=yes"
test -f .yamllint.yml && echo "YAML_LINT=yes"
test -f .pre-commit-config.yaml && echo "PRECOMMIT=yes"
```

**CI coverage check** (mandatory before running any
tool): Build and display a coverage matrix that maps
each detected local tool to the CI check from Step 3
that covers the same verification. Display this matrix
to make the skip/run decision visible:

| Local tool | CI check that covers it | CI status | Run locally? |
|------------|------------------------|-----------|--------------|
| `go test` | e.g., "Local CI / test" | PASS/FAIL/NONE | Yes/No |
| `golangci-lint` | e.g., "CI Checks / lint" | PASS/FAIL/NONE | Yes/No |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Decision rules:
- CI status PASS → skip locally ("No" — CI already
  verified)
- CI status FAIL → skip locally ("No" — failure already
  captured in Step 3a, will be analyzed in Step 8d)
- CI status NONE (no matching check) → MUST run
  locally ("Yes")
- No CI checks reported at all → MUST run ALL detected
  local tools ("Yes" for every row)

**Execution**: Run only the tools marked "Yes" in the
matrix above:

| Tool detected | Command to run | What it checks |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Makefile | `make lint` (or `make check`) | Project-defined lint/format/vet |
| `.golangci.yml` | `golangci-lint run ./...` | Go lint rules |
| `ruff.toml` / `pyproject.toml` | `ruff check .` | Python lint rules |
| `.yamllint.yml` | `yamllint .` | YAML lint rules |
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | `pre-commit run --all-files` | Pre-commit hooks |
| `go.mod` | `go test ./...` | Go tests |
| `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` | `pytest` or `python -m pytest` | Python tests |

**Record results**: Capture tool exit codes and output.
If tools pass, skip those categories in the AI review
entirely. If tools fail, include the failure output as
context.

**If no tools are detected**: Note this and proceed to
AI-based review for all categories.

### 5. Fetch Diff (Scoped)

Now fetch the diff, being token-conscious:

```bash
gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER>
```

**Large diff handling** (500+ lines):

`gh pr diff` does not support file path filters. For
large diffs, save the output to a temp file and
navigate it with targeted reads:

1. Save the full diff once:
   ```bash
   gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER> > /tmp/pr<PR_NUMBER>.diff
   ```
   (The tool runtime auto-saves truncated output to a
   file — use that path if available instead.)

2. Find file boundaries in the saved diff:
   ```bash
   grep -n '^diff --git' /tmp/pr<PR_NUMBER>.diff
   ```
   This returns line numbers for each file's diff
   section.

3. Read specific file sections using offset/limit on
   the saved file. Skip these files entirely:
   - Lock files: `package-lock.json`, `go.sum`,
     `yarn.lock`, `bun.lock`
   - Auto-generated: `*.pb.go`, `vendor/` contents
   - Binary files
   - CRAP baselines: `.gaze/baseline.json`

4. For very large PRs (2000+ lines or 50+ files),
   warn the user and ask whether to review all files
   or focus on specific ones.

**Do NOT attempt**:
- `gh pr diff <N> -- <path>` (unsupported, will fail)
- `git show <remote>/<branch>:<path>` (PR branch may
  not be on any configured remote)
- `git fetch <remote> <branch>` (PR may come from a
  fork or push directly to PR refs)

#### Accessing full file contents from the PR branch

If you need to read a complete file from the PR branch
(not just the diff), use the GitHub API. The PR branch
may not exist on any locally configured remote:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/<path>?ref=<headRefName> \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```

Use `<headRefName>` from the Step 2 metadata. If the
API call returns 404, 403, or empty content (files
>1 MB), fall back to reading from the saved diff file
and note in the review that full file content was
unavailable.

For accessing files on the PR branch, the agent MUST
use `gh api` exclusively. Any `git` subcommand
targeting the PR's head ref (`git show`, `git fetch`,
`git checkout`, `git diff` with remote refs) is
prohibited.

### 6. Locate Associated Specification

Search for a specification that matches this PR across all spec directories:

- Check if the PR branch name matches a spec directory:
  - `specs/<branch-name>/spec.md` (Speckit output)
  - `openspec/specs/<branch-name>/spec.md` (OpenSpec specs)
  - `openspec/changes/<branch-name>/proposal.md` (OpenSpec changes)
- Check if the PR description references a spec
- If not found locally, check the PR's changed file
  list (from Step 2 metadata) for spec artifacts. The
  spec may be introduced by the PR itself. If found
  in the changed file list, read the spec content from
  the saved diff (Step 5) rather than from the
  filesystem.
- If a Speckit spec is found, read only the **Functional Requirements** and **User Stories** sections (not the entire spec) to minimize token usage
- If an OpenSpec proposal is found, read only the **Capabilities** and **Impact** sections
- If no spec is found in any directory or in the PR's changed files, note this and use the PR title and description as the intent source

#### 6a. Resolve Linked Issues

Parse the PR body (from Step 2 metadata) for issue
references using case-insensitive regex:
- `Fixes #N`, `Closes #N`, `Resolves #N`
- GitHub URL variants:
  `Fixes https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/N`

**Validation and limits**:
- Validate each parsed issue number as a positive
  integer (digits only). Discard non-numeric values.
- URL-format references: validate they belong to the
  same `{owner}/{repo}` as the PR. List cross-repo
  references in the output as "cross-repo — not
  validated" but do NOT fetch them.
- Limit to 5 linked issues maximum. If more than 5
  are found, list extras as "listed but not fetched"
  in the output.

**Fetching**: For each in-scope linked issue:

```bash
gh issue view <N> --json title,body,labels
```

**Untrusted input handling**: Issue body content is
user-controlled. Before incorporating into the review
context:
- Truncate to a maximum of 2000 characters.

**Error handling**: If `gh issue view` returns 404,
403, or times out, log the error, skip that issue, and
note in the `### Linked Issues` section as "fetch
failed". The review continues without blocking.

**Acceptance criteria extraction**: From each fetched
issue body, extract:
- Checkbox lines (`- [ ]` or `- [x]`)
- Content under an `## Acceptance Criteria` heading

If neither exists, use the issue title and body as
general intent context for the alignment check
(Step 8a).

Record the linked issues and their acceptance criteria
for use in Step 8a and Step 9.

### 7. Load Convention Packs (Optional)

Check if convention packs are available for enhanced review precision:

```bash
test -d .opencode/uf/packs && echo "PACKS=yes"
```

**If packs are available**:
1. Always read `.opencode/uf/packs/default.md` (language-agnostic rules)
2. Detect language and load the appropriate pack:
   - `go.mod` exists → read `.opencode/uf/packs/go.md`
   - `tsconfig.json` or `package.json` exists → read `.opencode/uf/packs/typescript.md`
3. Read corresponding `-custom.md` files if they exist (e.g., `go-custom.md`)
4. Read `.opencode/uf/packs/severity.md` if it exists — use its severity definitions instead of the inline fallback in Step 8
5. Do NOT load `content.md` or `content-custom.md` — these contain writing standards for documentation agents, not code quality rules

Use pack rules (CS-001, AP-001, SC-001, TC-001, DR-001, etc.) alongside the constitution for more specific, actionable findings. Reference the specific rule ID in each finding.

**If packs are NOT available**: proceed without them. Use the constitution and inline severity definitions only. No error or warning needed.

### 7.5. Fetch Existing Review State

Fetch existing PR reviews and inline comments to prevent
duplicate findings and provide context for the AI review.

#### 7.5a. Fetch Reviews

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/reviews \
  --jq '[.[] | {id: .id, user: .user.login, state: .state, body: .body, submitted_at: .submitted_at, commit_id: .commit_id}]'
```

Record each review's user, state (`APPROVED`,
`CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `COMMENTED`, `DISMISSED`), body,
and commit ID.

#### 7.5b. Fetch Inline Comments

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | {path: .path, line: .line, body: .body, user: .user.login, created_at: .created_at}]'
```

Record each inline comment's file path, line number,
body, and author.

#### 7.5c. Identify Current User

```bash
gh api user --jq '.login'
```

Record the authenticated user's login for duplicate
review detection in Step 11.

#### 7.5d. Token Budget

Existing review comments passed to Step 8 MUST be capped
at 3000 characters total to prevent token bloat. When the
combined comment text exceeds this limit:
1. Filter to comments on files changed in this PR
2. Sort by `created_at` descending (most recent first)
3. Include comments until the 3000-character budget is
   exhausted
4. Truncate the remainder with a note: "N additional
   prior comments truncated for token budget"

#### 7.5e. Error Handling

If any `gh api` call in this step returns 403, 404, or
times out:
- Log the error
- Skip the failed sub-step
- Proceed to Step 8 without the missing context

The review continues without blocking. All review state
data is additive context — its absence does not reduce
the review's capability, only its deduplication accuracy.

### 8. AI Review (Judgment-Based Only)

Focus AI analysis exclusively on what deterministic tools and CI cannot check. Skip any category where local tools or CI already passed.

**Existing review deduplication** (using Step 7.5 data):
Before generating findings, cross-reference existing
inline comments from Step 7.5b against the current
analysis. For each finding:
- If an existing inline comment covers the same file and
  line range with a similar concern: **annotate** the
  finding as "previously raised by @user" rather than
  presenting it as new. Include the annotation in the
  output.
- If an existing review thread appears resolved (the
  author pushed fixes after the comment): **acknowledge**
  this in the finding context.
- If prior reviewer discussions provide relevant context
  for a finding: **reference** them (e.g., "Related to
  @user's comment on the same file").
- Do NOT fully suppress findings — the current review may
  have additional context or a different severity
  assessment. Annotate, don't hide.

**Path-based review focus**: Before starting the review,
classify each changed file against these built-in
heuristics. Record the focus category for each file
(used in the Walkthrough output and as additive review
context):

| Path pattern | Focus category | Additional emphasis |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| `*_test.go`, `*_test.py`, `**/__tests__/**`, `**/*_spec.*` | `test-quality` | Edge cases, assertion strength, mock isolation, test naming |
| `**/cmd/**`, `**/cli/**` | `cli-ux` | Error messages, flag validation, help text |
| `**/api/**`, `**/handler/**`, `**/middleware/**`, `**/routes/**` | `security` | Auth, input validation, injection |
| `*.md`, `docs/**` | `documentation` | Clarity, accuracy, broken links |
| `.github/workflows/**`, `Dockerfile*` | `ci-cd` | Permissions, pinned versions, secrets exposure |
| `go.mod`, `package.json`, `requirements.txt` | `dependencies` | Maintenance status, license, scope |
| Everything else | `standard` | Architecture, SOLID, coupling, baseline security |

Path focus is **additive** — it supplements the standard
review categories (alignment, security, constitution),
not replaces them. Step 8b (Security Review) applies to
ALL changed files regardless of path heuristic.

When reviewing each file, append the matched focus
instruction to the review context for that file.

**Walkthrough generation**: While analyzing each file's
diff, generate a one-line change summary describing
what changed (e.g., "Add error handling for null
inputs"), not how (no code snippets). Record the
summary and focus category for each file — these are
used in the `### Walkthrough` output section (Step 9).
For PRs with 30+ files, generate directory-level
summaries instead of per-file summaries.

#### 8a. Alignment Check

Compare the PR intent (title + description + linked spec + linked issues) against the actual code changes:

- **Scope alignment**: Do the changed files match what the spec/description says should change? Flag files modified outside the stated scope.
- **Requirement coverage**: For each requirement in the spec (if found), verify the code changes address it. Flag uncovered requirements.
- **Completeness**: Are there partial implementations that could leave the system in an inconsistent state?
- **Drift detection**: Does the code do anything NOT described in the intent/spec? Flag undocumented behavioral changes.
- **Issue criteria coverage**: For each acceptance criterion from linked issues (Step 6a), verify the code changes address it. Report uncovered criteria as MEDIUM findings with per-criterion status (COVERED / NOT COVERED / PARTIAL).

#### 8b. Security Review

Examine the diff for security vulnerabilities that linters cannot catch:

- **Input sanitization**: Are external inputs (user input, API parameters, file paths, environment variables, command arguments) validated before use in:
  - SQL queries (injection risk)
  - Shell commands (command injection)
  - File paths (path traversal)
  - HTML/template output (XSS)
  - YAML/JSON parsing (deserialization attacks)
- **Unexpected workflows**: Can the code be executed in an unintended order or context?
  - Missing authentication/authorization checks
  - Race conditions or TOCTOU vulnerabilities
  - State machine violations (skipping steps)
  - Error handling that exposes sensitive information
- **Privilege escalation**: Does the code grant permissions or elevate privileges without proper validation?
- **Secrets and credentials**: Are there hardcoded secrets, tokens, or API keys? Are secrets logged or exposed in error messages?
- **Dependency risks**: Are new dependencies well-maintained and from trusted sources?

#### 8c. Constitution Compliance (AI-only items)

Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` if it exists. Extract all principles and their MUST/SHOULD rules. For each principle, check whether the PR's changes comply. **Only check items that local tools and CI did NOT already verify.**

If no constitution file exists, note this and review against general software engineering best practices. Do NOT hardcode specific principle names or numbers — each project defines its own constitution.

**Skip if already covered by local tools or CI**: naming conventions, line length, lint issues, formatting, file headers.

#### 8d. CI Failure Analysis

For each CI failure classified in Step 3a, provide analysis:

**PR-caused failures**: Include as HIGH or CRITICAL findings:
- Which check failed and what the error output says
- Which PR change likely caused the failure (map failing test to changed file/function)
- Suggested fix or direction

**Pre-existing failures**: Report separately with clear labeling:
- Confirm the failure also exists on the base branch
- Brief root cause analysis if determinable from the error output
- Note that this will be addressed in Step 10 (fix-branch offer)

### 9. Output Format

Present findings in this structured format:

```markdown
## PR Review: #<NUMBER> — <TITLE>

### CI Status
| Check | Status | Classification |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| <name> | PASS/FAIL | PR-caused / Pre-existing / N/A |

### Local Tool Results
<Table showing which tools ran, pass/fail status, and summary of failures if any>

### Walkthrough
| File | Change | Focus |
|------|--------|-------|
| `internal/gateway/provider.go` | Add token expiry tracking | security |
| `internal/gateway/gateway_test.go` | Add regression test for stale tokens | test-quality |
| `cmd/unbound-force/gateway.go` | Register --provider flag | cli-ux |

<For PRs with 30+ files, group by directory with counts:>
| Directory | Files | Summary | Focus |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------|
| `internal/gateway/` | 3 | Token refresh and provider detection | security |

### Linked Issues
<Only include this section if Step 6a found linked issues>
| Issue | Title | Criteria |
|-------|-------|----------|
| #38 | Export metrics to CSV | 3/4 COVERED |
|      | | ✓ CSV export with headers |
|      | | ✓ Date range filtering |
|      | | ✓ Output to stdout or file |
|      | | ✗ Support custom delimiters |
| #999 | (fetch failed) | — |

### Summary
<1-2 sentence assessment of what the PR does and overall quality. When a Walkthrough is present, the Summary serves as an assessment summary (overall verdict context), not a structural overview — the Walkthrough fills that role.>

### Alignment
- <Finding with severity>

### Security
- <Finding with severity>

### Constitution Compliance
- <Finding with severity>

### CI Failures (PR-caused)
- <Finding with severity — only if PR-caused failures exist>

### CI Failures (Pre-existing)
- <Description — only if pre-existing failures exist>
- Note: These failures exist independently of this PR. See fix-branch offer below.

### Verdict
**<APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / COMMENT>**

<Brief justification. Pre-existing CI failures do NOT block the PR verdict.>
```

**Severity levels** (use `.opencode/uf/packs/severity.md` definitions if loaded in Step 7, otherwise use these defaults):
- **CRITICAL**: Must be fixed before merge (security vulnerabilities, data loss risks)
- **HIGH**: Should be fixed before merge (spec violations, missing tests for critical paths, PR-caused CI failures)
- **MEDIUM**: Recommended to fix (code quality, minor compliance issues)
- **LOW**: Optional improvements (style, naming suggestions)

If no issues are found in a category, state "No issues found."

### 10. Offer Fix-Branch for Pre-existing CI Failures

If Step 3a identified any **pre-existing** CI failures, offer to create a fix branch:

```
I identified <N> pre-existing CI failure(s) that are NOT caused by this PR:
- <check name>: <brief description of failure>

These failures also occur on the base branch (<BASE_BRANCH>).

Would you like me to create a fix branch with a proposed resolution?
I will create the branch and commit locally — you can review the changes and file a PR when ready.
```

**If the user agrees**:

1. **Verify clean working tree**:
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   If the output is not empty: **STOP** branch creation with message:
   > "Working tree has uncommitted changes. Commit or stash them before creating a fix branch."
   Switch back to the PR branch and continue to Step 11.

2. **Check for branch name collision**:
   ```bash
   git branch --list "fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<check-name>"
   ```
   If the branch already exists, inform the user:
   > "Branch `fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<check-name>` already exists. Switch to it with `git checkout fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<check-name>`, or delete it first."
   Switch back to the PR branch and continue to Step 11.

3. **Sanitize the check name** for branch-name safety:
   lowercase, replace spaces and special characters with
   hyphens, strip consecutive hyphens, remove characters
   outside `[a-z0-9._-]`, truncate to 50 characters.
   Example: `"Build (ubuntu/latest)"` → `build-ubuntu-latest`.
   Also validate that `<PR_NUMBER>` is digits only.

4. **Create a fix branch** from the base branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout <BASE_BRANCH>
   git checkout -b fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<sanitized-check-name>
   ```
   Branch naming: `fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<sanitized-check-name>` (e.g., `fix/pr-42-yamllint`, `fix/pr-42-test-auth-timeout`)

5. **Analyze and propose the fix**: Use the CI failure output and the failing file(s) to determine the minimal change needed. Keep the scope as small as possible — fix only what is failing.

6. **Commit with Conventional Commits format**:
   Write the commit message to a temporary file to avoid
   shell injection from AI-generated description text,
   then commit using `-F`:
   ```bash
   git add <changed-files>
   git commit -s -F <temp-commit-message-file>
   ```
   The commit message file should contain:
   ```
   fix: resolve <failing-check> CI failure

   <Brief description of what was wrong and how the fix addresses it.>

   This failure was pre-existing on <BASE_BRANCH> and unrelated to PR #<PR_NUMBER>.

   Assisted-by: OpenCode (<model>)
   ```
   Remove the temp file after committing.

7. **Report to the user**:
   ```
   Fix branch created: fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<check-name>

   Changes:
   - <file>: <what changed>

   The branch is local. To review and push:
     git checkout fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<check-name>
     git log -1
     git push -u origin fix/pr-<PR_NUMBER>-<check-name>
   ```

8. **Switch back** to the PR branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout <PR_BRANCH>
   ```

**Guardrails**:
- The fix MUST be scoped to the specific failing check — no unrelated changes
- The agent MUST NOT push to the remote or file a PR automatically
- If the fix is non-trivial (requires understanding business logic, architectural decisions, or modifying more than 3 files), inform the user instead of attempting a fix:
  ```
  The CI failure in <check> appears to require a non-trivial fix involving <description>.
  I recommend investigating this separately rather than proposing an automated fix.
  ```

### 11. Offer Verdict-aligned PR Review

After presenting the review, if there are findings with
severity HIGH or above, offer to post them as a formal
GitHub review on the PR:

```
I found <N> findings (X CRITICAL, Y HIGH).
Verdict: <APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / COMMENT>

Would you like me to post this as a GitHub review so the
author can see the findings in context?

I will prepare the review and show it to you for approval
before posting anything.
```

**If the user agrees**:

#### 11a. Pre-posting Checks

Before preparing comments, run three state-awareness
checks using data from Step 7.5:

**Duplicate review detection**: Check if a review from
the current user (Step 7.5c) already exists in the
review list (Step 7.5a):

- If a prior review with the **same verdict** exists:
  ```
  You already have an <APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES> review
  on this PR. Post a new one? (The latest review takes
  precedence.)
  (yes/no)
  ```
- If a prior review with a **different verdict** exists:
  ```
  You have a prior <old_verdict> review. Post a new
  <new_verdict>? This will override the previous
  verdict.
  (yes/no)
  ```
- If no prior review exists: proceed silently.

**Stale review + CODEOWNER checks** (APPROVE verdicts
only): Fetch branch protection settings in a single API
call to avoid redundant requests:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/<baseRefName>/protection \
  --jq '{dismiss_stale: .required_pull_request_reviews.dismiss_stale_reviews, require_codeowners: .required_pull_request_reviews.require_code_owner_reviews}'
```

If the API returns 404 (no branch protection) or 403
(insufficient permissions): skip both checks silently.

If `dismiss_stale` is true, display:
```
Warning: This repo dismisses stale reviews. If the author
pushes any new commits after this APPROVE, it will be
automatically invalidated and the PR will return to
REVIEW_REQUIRED. You may need to re-run /review-pr after
final commits.
```

If `require_codeowners` is true, check for CODEOWNERS
file:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/CODEOWNERS \
  --jq '.name' 2>/dev/null || \
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/.github/CODEOWNERS \
  --jq '.name' 2>/dev/null
```

If CODEOWNERS exists and `require_code_owner_reviews` is
true, display:
```
Warning: This repo requires code owner reviews. This
APPROVE may not satisfy branch protection if this
account is not listed in CODEOWNERS.
```

If any API call fails: skip silently.

1. **Prepare comments**: For each finding that maps to a
   specific file and line range in the diff, prepare an
   in-line comment with:
   - The finding description
   - The severity level
   - A concrete suggestion for fixing the issue

   **Suggestion block format**: When a finding has a
   concrete single-file code fix (literal replacement),
   format it using GitHub's suggestion block syntax:

   ````
   **[HIGH] Description of the issue**

   ```suggestion
   corrected code here
   ```
   ````

   Use suggestion blocks ONLY for literal code
   replacements that can be applied as-is. MUST NOT use
   suggestion blocks for:
   - Architectural or design recommendations
   - Multi-file changes
   - Removal of security controls (input validation,
     auth checks, error handling, lint suppressions)

   For these cases, use plain text with an explanation.

   Cap at 15 comments maximum. If more than 15 findings
   qualify, prioritize CRITICAL over HIGH. Include
   remaining findings in the review body summary.

2. **Show all comments for human review**: Present each
   prepared comment with its full before/after context:
   ```
   File: <path>
   Line: <line_number>
   Type: suggestion / plain-text
   Body: <comment text with suggestion block if applicable>
   ```

3. **Verdict-aligned confirmation**: Map the verdict from
   Step 9 to the GitHub API event type:
   - APPROVE → `"event": "APPROVE"`
   - REQUEST CHANGES → `"event": "REQUEST_CHANGES"`
   - COMMENT → `"event": "COMMENT"`

   Display the confirmation prompt with the verdict type:

   For APPROVE verdicts:
   ```
   Post review as APPROVE with N comments?
   ⚠ This may unblock merge in repos with branch
     protection. This review will be labeled as
     AI-generated.
   Type "approve" to confirm:
   (approve/no/edit/change-verdict)
   ```

   For REQUEST CHANGES or COMMENT verdicts:
   ```
   Post review as REQUEST CHANGES with N comments?
   ⚠ This will block merge in repos with branch
     protection.
   (yes/no/edit/change-verdict)
   ```

   The `change-verdict` option lets the user override the
   computed verdict (e.g., downgrade REQUEST CHANGES to
   COMMENT).

4. **Post as a single review event**: Construct a JSON
   payload containing the event type, review body, and
   inline comments array. Write the payload to a
   temporary file and submit via:

   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/reviews \
     --method POST \
     --input <json-file>
   ```

   The review body MUST include the line:
   `_This review was generated by /review-pr
   (AI-assisted)._`

   Always write the JSON payload to a temporary file
   rather than interpolating AI-generated text into shell
   arguments, to prevent shell injection. Remove the
   temporary file after posting.

   **Graceful degradation**: If `gh api` returns HTTP 403
   or 422 (insufficient permissions, non-collaborator, or
   self-review prohibition), fall back to posting as
   `"event": "COMMENT"` with a note:
   > "Note: Could not post as <original verdict> due to
   > insufficient permissions. Posted as COMMENT instead.
   > Original verdict: <APPROVE/REQUEST CHANGES>."

   If the fallback also fails, inform the user that their
   token lacks write permissions for PR reviews and
   suggest re-authenticating with `gh auth login`.

   - **no**: Skip posting, the terminal summary is sufficient
   - **edit**: Let the user modify comments before posting, then re-confirm

5. **CRITICAL RULE**: NEVER post reviews without explicit
   human confirmation. Always show the exact content
   (verdict type + all comments) that will be posted and
   wait for approval. For APPROVE verdicts, require the
   user to type "approve" explicitly — not just "yes" —
   to prevent reflexive confirmation of merge-unblocking
   reviews.
