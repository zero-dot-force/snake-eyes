# Command: /dewey-store

## Description

Store ad-hoc knowledge (Slack DMs, meeting notes, decisions,
observations) as a Dewey learning. Supports three modes:
fully specified, suggested (agent analyzes text and proposes
tag/category), and extract (breaks a long conversation into
multiple learnings).

## Usage

```
/dewey-store --tag auth-design --category decision
Sarah confirmed we need OAuth2 + SAML for enterprise.

/dewey-store
Just talked to the team — we're switching to PostgreSQL.

/dewey-store --extract
[paste a long Slack conversation or meeting transcript]
```

## Instructions

### 1. Parse Input

Read the user's message after `/dewey-store`.

**Check for flags**:
- `--tag <value>`: Topic tag for the learning
- `--category <value>`: One of decision, pattern, gotcha, context, reference
- `--extract`: Enable multi-learning extraction mode

Everything after the flags is the **text to store**.

If no text is provided, ask:
> "What knowledge would you like to store? Paste the text."

### 2. Determine Mode

**Mode A: Fully Specified** (both --tag and --category provided)
Call store_learning immediately. Skip to Step 5.

**Mode B: Suggested** (no --tag or no --category)
Proceed to Step 3.

**Mode C: Extract** (--extract flag present)
Proceed to Step 4.

### 3. Analyze and Suggest (Mode B)

**Tag suggestion**: Suggest 2-3 tags ranked by specificity.

**Category suggestion**: Classify based on content:
- "decided", "agreed", "confirmed" → decision
- "watch out", "gotcha", "careful" → gotcha
- "pattern", "approach", "technique" → pattern
- URL, "see also", "reference" → reference
- Default → context

Wait for user confirmation before calling store_learning.

### 4. Multi-Learning Extraction (Mode C)

Identify distinct pieces of knowledge. Present as numbered
list with tag/category for each. Wait for confirmation.

### 5. Post-Store

Display the returned identity and suggest /dewey-compile.
